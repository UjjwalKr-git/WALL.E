# **WALL.E** *1.0*
WALL.E is an Obstacle Avoiding Robot with so many applications..!\
I made this as a *collage* as well as ***hobby project*** but its applications are in many fields.
\
In this modern era, the demand of autonomous machines have gained a high value due to its usefulness and vast area of applications, keeping this in mind, a robot, which is compact, autonomous, and fully functional.\
This Robot detects obstacle and changes its course according to it. **This functionality enables this model to be applied in many areas like *Defence, Rescue Missions in areas out of human reach, Autonomous Vehicles, Automated Home Appliances (like Automated Vacuum Cleaners)***.\
**In conclusion**, through this project, the aim is to construct a model of a smart-robot that is beneficial to the quotidian problems of the present generation.

## Applications : -
➢ If there is an obstacle in the route of the robot, it can detect and avoid it. Thus, it can move without having damaged by any obstacle which makes it more reliable. Thus, it can be used to make Automated Cars that can avoid accidents, hence many lives could be saved.\
➢ The modification of this logic code is used in Automated Vacuum Cleaners.\
➢ This robot can be used for avoiding concealed paths, such as an industrial robot in a factory is expected to avoid workers so that it won’t hurt them.\
➢ They have great importance in scientific exploration and emergency rescue, there may be places that are dangerous for humans or even impossible for humans to reach directly, then we should use robots to help us gather information to about their surrounding challenging environments.\
➢ And MUCH MORE.
